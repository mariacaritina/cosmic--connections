My project matches people based on their astrological sign. It fulfills the following three requirements: 
1. Create an array, populate it with multiple values and retrieve at lease one value and have it display on the application 
2.Data is retreived from a public API in order to show the user the person they've been matched with. 
3. A conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it.
